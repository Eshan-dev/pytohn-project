   - Get your API key

4. **Set up your API key:**
   
   **Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   set OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   
   # Linux/Mac
   export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   
   **Option 2: Direct in code**
   - Open `app.py`
   - Replace `'your_api_key_here'` with your actual API key

## Usage

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser and go to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. **View the results:**
   - Current weather conditions
   - Temperature and feels-like temperature
   - Humidity, wind speed, and pressure
   - Personalized clothing recommendations

## How It Works

### Weather Data
- Uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data
- Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and weather description
- Shows both actual temperature and "feels like" temperature

### Clothing Recommendations
The app provides smart clothing suggestions based on:

**Temperature-based recommendations:**
- Below 0¬∞C: Heavy winter gear
- 0-10¬∞C: Winter coat and warm clothing
- 10-20¬∞C: Light jacket and long sleeves
- 20-30¬∞C: T-shirt and light clothing
- Above 30¬∞C: Light, breathable summer wear

**Weather condition-based recommendations:**
- Rain: Waterproof clothing and umbrella
- Snow: Snow boots and warm gear
- Sunny: Sun protection items
- Windy: Wind-resistant clothing
- High humidity: Breathable, moisture-wicking fabrics

## API Key Setup
